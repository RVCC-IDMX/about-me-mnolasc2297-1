       <div>
<p>My name is Manuel Nolasco, although everyone call me Manny. I am a returning student here at RVCC
    looking for a change in career and I decided on Information Technology. I grew up in New jersey
    my whole life and have a passion for art. I like and appreciatte all kinds of art, wether that be
    film, photography, music or hands-on crafts. I am originally from Mexico City and love to visit
    from time to time when I can. If you're reading this, take this is a personal recommendations to go
    try some authentic Mexican food. I am a major procrastinator which is one of my weaknesses but I am 
    slowly learning to conquer it. Music is usually a good tool that allows me to work and focus on
    my task on hand. As I am typing this biography I'm listening to some of my favorite Mexican artists.

            <li>I love to shut off the world, put on my headphones, grab a water bottle
                and ride off on my favorite trail for hours. Below in my gallery you will see a picture that was taken on my 3 hours
                ride on the South Bound Brook Canal. Starts in New Brunswick and goes to....well I 
                haven't gone all the way yet.
            </li>  

            <li>Although I'm not a professional, I love to photograph cool pictures and locations I visit. Particulary 
                attracted to any kind of street art that I come across, but I love a good New York City trip as well </li>

            <li>Recently I got into paiting, I actually started a small custom sneaker side business. It started during the quarentine
                when everyone was stuck at home. Came across a Youtube tutorial, and the rest is history.

        <h2>Animated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</h2>

                    

    <div><p> We all visit the internet often and see various logos and images, apart from actual pictures our friends post. I think we take for granted how clean and smooth websites&rsquo; logo look and adapt to our platforms. A lot of web developers rely on Animated Scalable Vector Graphics, or (SVG) to create these beautiful logos. The SVG file format is an XML-based vector image format (much like HMTL) that provides scalability without limit to ensure that your designs can function across different mediums and sizes. This way your logo can both look good on the screen of your iPhone but also on a Billboard in Philly. As mentioned, these images use XML or eXtensible Markup Language, yes you understood that right. These files can manipulated with a graphic design software, or simple text editor.</p>

        <p>Being that these images are text based, they are generally packaged in a small size. If you have any designer or developer friends, ask them how great this is. The small size file allows a great-looking graphic that not only loads fast, but also improves the user experience. The use of SVG files actually helps to be able to index and CSS styling can work with images that render in 8K, if that isn&rsquo;t neat I&rsquo;m not sure what is. Scalable vector graphics are for the most part used in the digital world, for illustration, web icons, charts, digital cut files, all key components of web designs. Being able to scale these files so well is a perfect tool for a variety of web sites. They allow these designs to load quickly and look great across all platforms and devices. I spent the first half talking about how great SVGs are but they also have their limitations like all things should. It is an excellent tool for web icons, logos and general illustration but it can never quite capture realism like we do in our photography.</p>
        
        <p>Being that is rather a new method of technology that we started using in 2017, we can&rsquo;t quite capture the meat and potatoes of high-level detail that we do in our high-resolution cameras, and we all have them now on our mobile devices. As of today, SVG files are still giving older platforms compatibility issues such as legacy browsers and any version of Internet Explorer 8 or lower. I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear that the use of this format is mainly intended for designers. If this sounds like something that is of interest to you there all plenty of amazing resources that you use to learn more about SVGs. I will list some of them at the bottom of this blog. There are other methods to enhance your SVG files such as &ldquo;paths&rdquo; that are extremely useful but these links might help you learn a bit more with plenty of visual examples. As a fun fact both my avatar and my favicon on this site are SVG files so feel free to zoom in and watch how the resolution remains intact.</p>
